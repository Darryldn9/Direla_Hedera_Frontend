# WhatsApp Integration Flows

## Flow 1: Send Payment Request from Web App via WhatsApp

### The Business Problem
You want users to be able to request payments from contacts who may not have your app installed, using WhatsApp as the delivery mechanism.

### High-Level Flow

1. User fills out payment form on your web app (amount, memo, recipient contact)
2. Instead of processing immediate payment, system creates a "payment request" record
3. Web app opens WhatsApp with pre-filled message containing a secure payment link
4. Recipient receives WhatsApp message with payment link
5. Recipient clicks link, goes to your web app's payment page
6. Recipient authenticates (creates account if needed) and authorizes payment
7. Payment processes through your existing Hedera infrastructure

### What You Need to Build

#### Database Changes
- Payment requests table storing: unique token, sender account, amount, memo, expiration time, status
- Track which requests are fulfilled vs expired

#### Backend API Endpoints
- Create payment request endpoint (generates secure token, stores request details)
- Payment fulfillment endpoint (validates token, shows payment details to recipient)
- Payment processing endpoint (handles recipient's payment authorization)

#### Frontend Changes
- Add "Request via WhatsApp" option to payment forms
- Build payment fulfillment page for recipients (linked from WhatsApp message)
- Handle WhatsApp deep linking to open messaging app with pre-filled text

#### Security Considerations
- Payment request tokens must expire (24-48 hours recommended)
- Rate limiting on payment request creation
- Validation that sender has sufficient authority to request payments

## Flow 2: Full WhatsApp Platform Integration

### The Business Problem
Users want to access all your app's functionality through WhatsApp conversations, making your platform truly multi-channel.

### High-Level Architecture
Transform WhatsApp into a conversational interface that mirrors your web app's capabilities through intelligent chat interactions.

### Core Components Needed

#### Conversation State Management
- Track where each user is in multi-step processes (sending payments, generating QR codes, viewing history)
- Store conversation context so users don't have to repeat information
- Handle conversation timeouts and cleanup

#### Natural Language Processing
- Remove command-based syntax (no more `/pay`, `/balance`)
- Parse user intent from casual messages ("send john 25 dollars", "check my balance", "make a QR code")
- Handle ambiguous inputs gracefully with clarifying questions

#### Account Linking System
- Secure method to connect WhatsApp phone numbers to your app accounts
- Web-based authentication flow (users log in on web to authorize WhatsApp linking)
- Handle multiple accounts per user and account switching

#### Feature Parity Implementation
- Balance checking across all user accounts
- Payment sending with recipient validation and confirmation flows
- Transaction history with filtering and details
- QR code generation for receiving payments (different amounts, expiration times)
- Business features (invoicing, analytics, customer management)

#### Multi-Step Conversation Flows
Design conversation trees for complex operations:
- **Payment flow**: recipient → amount → memo → confirmation
- **QR generation**: amount (optional) → expiration → sharing options
- **Business invoice**: customer → amount → description → send method

#### Integration Points
- All WhatsApp operations must use your existing Hedera services (no duplicate logic)
- Maintain audit trails and transaction logs across both platforms
- Synchronize state between web app and WhatsApp (if user makes payment on web, WhatsApp shows updated balance)

#### User Experience Considerations
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly explanations
- Progress indicators for long operations (blockchain transactions)
- Fallback options when WhatsApp limitations are hit (file attachments, complex forms)

#### Technical Architecture Needs
- Conversation context database schema
- Message routing and intent classification system
- State machine for managing multi-step flows
- Integration layer connecting WhatsApp service to existing business logic
- Queue system for handling high-volume message processing
